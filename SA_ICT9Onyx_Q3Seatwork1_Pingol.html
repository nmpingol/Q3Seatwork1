            <h3>Lorelai Gilmore</h3>
            <p>Protrayed by Lauren Graham, Lorelai is the mother of Rory and she runs the Independence Inn. Since childhood, she didn't have a very good relationship with her parents at home. Her mother was very controlling and judgemental while her father had all of his focus on work. She had her daughter when she was 16, and ran away from her parents house in Hartford to a humble house in Stars Hollow. Even though she has a privelleged background, she worked her way up to where she is now. From being a maid at the Independence Inn to owning it. She raised her daughter as a single mother. Often praising her, making her daughter believe she is the best. The duo are known to have electric personalites, be fast talkers, and food lovers. </p>

            <h3>Rory Gilmore</h3>
            <p>Played by Alexis Bledel, she is the loved daughter of Lorelai Gilmore. She is constantly being praised by her mother, her neighbours, and her grandparents. This unfortunately gives her a golden child or superiority complex mindset. She studies at Chilton High School. She is known to read a lot of books. It was also mentioned that ever since she was very young, she wanted to go to Harvard in college. In the first season, we can see that she is kind of a perfectionist. She often has lists, is very organized, and always studies. She cannot handle making mistakes or falling behind even just a bit.</p>

            <h3>Emily Gilmore</h3>
            <p>Played by Kelly Bishop, she is Lorelai's mother and Rory's grandmother. She is a wealthy socialite who lives in Hartfort with her husband. A funny trait about her is that she fires her maids all the time, so she has a different maid every week. She finds showing emotions as a weakness, in turn she often avoids being vulnerable or compassionate to her family. Throwing money at people seems to be the way she shows love. Throughout the series, we can see the dynamic of her relationship with her daughter and grandaughter. </p>

He can show affection towards his grandaughter and he defends his daughter when she is being targetted.</p>
